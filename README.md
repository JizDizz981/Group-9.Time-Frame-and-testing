Then Khai Hung will need to develop the database schema or knowledge graph structure to store FAQ data. Fill up the information base with categorized questions and answers. He must ensure that the knowledge base is easily expandable and updateable for future additions or changes.
Lastly, Quoc Vuong will complete the implementation of the chatbot backend. He may develop the necessary code or configure the chosen platform to integrate the questions and responses into chatbot system.

            <td>A chatbot's frontend and backend development include creating both the user-facing interface (frontend and the underlying logic and functionality (backend). Quoc Vuong and Duc Thinh create the chatbot's graphical user interface on the frontend, allowire users to interact with it easily. This comprises layout design, input form implementation, and response display. On the other hand, Backend development, focuses on managing user inputs; Lan Hsin and Khai Hung will process natural language understanding, provide suitable responses, and integrate with external systems as needed. During the development process, machine learning models will be trained and deployed to increase the chatbot's accuracy and performance. Then test and improve the user experience by ensuring simple navigation and clear FAQ display.</td>

Lan Hsin will identify issues such as misspellings, incorrect input, and unclear questions to see whether the chatbot provides a helpful response or sent the users to relevant resources,or failed to deliver a sufficient response. While Quoc Vuong and Duc Thinh will be focusing on debugging the issues by inspecting the code then conduct user acceptability testing with a focus group to get input and make any necessary modifications in the application.
Khai Hung will concentrate on improving chatbot error handling. Use the findings from the evaluation to improve the chatbot's error handling. He will entail adding new responses to chatbot's knowledge base, improving its natural language processing abilities, or refining its conversation flow. The chatbot should not crash or deliver inaccurate information.</td>

We will deploy the chatbot through the preferred platform and actively monitor its interactions with users once we are satisfied with its functionality. Later on we will Collect feedback and analyze user comments to identify areas for improvement. Feedback improves the user experience by addressing frequently asked issues and concerns. Our group will Actively seek and analyze feedback to help identify areas for improvement, which will aid us in improving the bot's accuracy and effectiveness in providing helpful responses.</td>
